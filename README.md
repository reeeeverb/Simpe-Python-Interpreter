# Interpreter
just a little interpreter project, going to be implementing the python language with C. Will probably come back at some point and implement it in Haskell.

### TO DO
- First we are going to implement the bytecode language and VM to execute it
- Needs a way to construct a bytecode program using add chunk fns
- Then we want to contruct a scanner that is easily reusable for a compiler and other future projects
